Checking out locally a spiral as a tag

git checkout s00

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and
commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches
by peforming another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or
later) by using -b with checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b s00a

A new version of a spiral as a branch

  git checkout -b s00a

Makes changes in s00a

  1. change script in MagicBoxes.html
  2. add // branch s00a in MagicBoxes.dart
  3. add .gitignore to ignore MagicBoxes.dart.js and *~ (Ubuntu backup files)

  git status

    modified:  MagicBoxes.dart
    deleted:   MagicBoxes.dart.app.js
    modified:  MagicBoxes.html

  Untracked files:

    .gitignore

  git rm MagicBoxes.dart.app.js
  git add .
  git commit -m "script changes in s00a"

Push local branch to GitHub

  git push origin s00a
